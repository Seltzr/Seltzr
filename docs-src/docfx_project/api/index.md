# API Documentation
API documentation is available for Seltzr here. Classes are broken down by namespaces and are mostly grouped together by their position in the <xref:request-flow>. If you're just building an API, the class you're probably most interested in is <xref:Seltzr.Options.Builder.SeltzrOptionsBuilder`2>.
