# ![logo](favicon.png) Seltzr
Welcome to Seltzr! Seltzr is a declarative, options-based framework for ASP.NET Core, designed to create database-backed REST APIs with as little code as possible.

## What Seltzr Is
Seltzr is:
* A lightweight platform for building REST APIs
* Middleware for ASP.NET Core
* Compatible with Entity Framework Core
* A bridge between the database and the API consumers

## What Seltzr Is Not
Before we get too far, it's also important to cover what Seltzr isn't:

* A database
* An ORM like EntityFramework
* An HTTP Server

While Seltzr works with these components to create a fully-functioning API, Seltzr alone cannot provide them.

## Getting Started
To get started with Seltzr, check out the <xref:getting-started> guide.

## Roadmap
* Compatibility with Dapper, other ORMs
* Centralized store/API for working with/providing API keys
